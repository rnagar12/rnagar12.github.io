This is version 1 of my personal website. 

I first started with the Phantom template from HTML5 UP, however, only kept the basic javascript functions from the template.
I also reused some of the basic CSS coding to use as a starting point. The rest has been developed by me using only HTML and CSS.

The website is still in the build stages. The following sections are still in the works:
  - Featured projects highlights
  - New and in progress projects
  - Contact footer
